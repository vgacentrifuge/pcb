* TODO
[X] Switch pullups to 2.2k
[ ] Add the connectors Paolo expects
[X] 124k -> 120k + 4.7k
[X] 5.49M -> 5.6M
[ ] Some LEDs for the MCU
[X] Add pinouts for power input
[ ] Add symbol for LCD

* Power circuit
[X] Are all resistors and capacitors the correct values?
[X] Did we calculate correct inductance values?
[X] Is everything connected as supposed to (see pcb lecture)
[ ] Use multiple Vias for connecting to ground plane
[ ] We do actually use the 16-pin PWP footprint?

[X] The barrel jack has a footprint that works
[X] The barrel jack pin numbers match in datasheet, footprint and schematic

* MCU
Datasheet: https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/data-sheets/efm32gg-datasheet.pdf
AN0002 Hardware considerations: https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an0002.0-efm32-ezr32-series-0-hardware-design-considerations.pdf

** Power delivery
[X] Do we provide power to all power inputs (REG, IO and Analog)
[X] All ground pins connected?
[ ] Are decoupling capacitors placed well?

** Choice of output pins
[ ] Make sure all pins are correct in schematic, and support what we want to use them for
NOTE: Make sure you always look at the BGA112 package!

[X] Make sure all features we use are available on the 990
The 990 fully implements the 2x I2C and 3x USART described elsewhere in the datasheet.

[X] Make sure the GPIO pins are available on the 990!
See table 5.20.3 GPIO Pinout Overview.

** Footprint
[ ] Are the pins in the correct locations, correct solder pad size and such?

** Debug header
[ ] Is it correctly laid out?

** Crystal
Oups, we bought an osciallator, not a crystal.
We should buy a crystal instead, to stay true to the pcb lecture schematic and AN0002.
[ ] Are the capacitors correctly placed on the PCB?
[ ] Use KiCADs differental pair routing?
[ ] Is the ground plane correctly formed under the crystal?

* I2C
[ ] Buy both 2k and 4.7k pullups in case we need to switch

* Connectors
[ ] Check that the 20-pin debug connector is already bought (1.27mm 2x10 male pin header)
For all other pin headers, just buy a fair amount of 1-row and 2-row breakup-able pin headers.
[ ] Buy 2x per board of 2x20: https://www.digikey.no/no/products/detail/sullins-connector-solutions/PREC020DFAN-RC/2774994
[ ] Buy 1x per board of 1x20: https://www.digikey.no/no/products/detail/sullins-connector-solutions/PRPC020SACN-RC/2776086

* SD card
[ ] Everything connected correctly
[ ] Pullup resistors make sense
[ ] Footprint matches the slot we have bought

* LCD screen
[ ] Check that the footprint is correct in terms of size and holes, and connection point

* Keyboard matrix
[ ] Is the custom footprint correct size?

* FPGA
[ ] Does it get everything it needs from the MCU?

* In general
[ ] Do all parts we purchase have correct parameters (as specified in schematic)
[ ] Do all footprints actually fit the parts we buy / have bought?
