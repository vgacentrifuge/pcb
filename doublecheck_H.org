* TODO
[X] Switch pullups to 2.2k
[X] Add the connectors Paolo expects
[X] 124k -> 120k + 4.7k
[X] 5.49M -> 5.6M
[X] Some LED for the MCU
[X] Add pinouts for power input
[X] Add symbol for LCD
[X] Add #0 to debug pins as well
[X] Change power supply EN pullups to lower resistance (min 1400 Ohm, currently 100k Ohm)

* Power circuit
[X] Are all resistors and capacitors the correct values?
[X] Did we calculate correct inductance values?
[X] Is everything connected as supposed to (see pcb lecture)
[X] Use multiple Vias for connecting to ground plane
[X] We do actually use the 16-pin PWP footprint? Yes

[X] The barrel jack has a footprint that works
[X] The barrel jack pin numbers match in datasheet, footprint and schematic
[X] Do all inductors have the correct footprint

* MCU
Datasheet: https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/data-sheets/efm32gg-datasheet.pdf
AN0002 Hardware considerations: https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an0002.0-efm32-ezr32-series-0-hardware-design-considerations.pdf

** Power delivery
[X] Do we provide power to all power inputs (REG, IO and Analog)
[X] All ground pins connected?
[HOPE SO] Are decoupling capacitors placed well?

** Choice of output pins
[X] Make sure all pins are correct in schematic, and support what we want to use them for
NOTE: Make sure you always look at the BGA112 package!

[X] Make sure all features we use are available on the 990
The 990 fully implements the 2x I2C and 3x USART described elsewhere in the datasheet.

[X] Make sure the GPIO pins are available on the 990!
See table 5.20.3 GPIO Pinout Overview.

** Footprint
[X] Are the pins in the correct locations, correct solder pad size and such?

** Debug header
[X] Is it correctly laid out?

** Crystal
Oups, we bought an osciallator, not a crystal.
We should buy a crystal instead, to stay true to the pcb lecture schematic and AN0002.
[X] Are the capacitors correctly placed on the PCB?
[NO] Use KiCADs differental pair routing? No need.
[X] Is the ground plane correctly formed under the crystal?

* I2C
[ ] Buy both 2k and 4.7k pullups in case we need to switch

* Connectors
[X] Check that the 20-pin debug connector is already bought (1.27mm 2x10 male pin header)

For all other pin headers, just buy a fair amount of 1-row and 2-row through hole breakup-able pin headers.
[X] Count the number of 2.54mm pin headers we have per board:
 2-row: (6 PSU disconnect)+(6 PSU breakout)+(4 MCU extra IO)+(5+3+2 FPGA extra IO) = 26 cols
 1-row: (4 MCU extra IO)+((4) MCU-FPGA SPI breakout)+(2+2+2 I2C breakout)+(4 LCU connector)+(8 keypad top) = 26 cols
 Buy enough for 3, and breaking a bunch.
Cheap [[https://www.digikey.no/no/products/detail/sullins-connector-solutions/PRPC040SACN-RC/2776066][1-row x 40]] and [[https://www.digikey.no/no/products/detail/sullins-connector-solutions/PRPC013DFAN-RC/2775401][2-row x 18]]

[X] Buy 8-wide 2.54mm female pin header for easy on and off for the keypad [[https://www.digikey.no/no/products/detail/sullins-connector-solutions/PPTC081LFBN-RC/810147][1-row x 8 female]].

[X] Do we have enough shunts to connect things (6x 5-wide and 25x 1-wide shunts is plenty)

* SD card
[X] Everything connected correctly
[X] Pullup resistors make sense (we have 5, can just de-solder if needed)
[X] Footprint matches the slot we have bought

* LCD screen
[ ] Check that the footprint is correct in terms of size and holes, and connection point

* Keyboard matrix
[SHOULD BE] Is the custom footprint correct size? Used the picture.

* FPGA
[ ] Does it get everything it needs from the MCU?

* SRAM
[X] Footprint correct

* DDC
[X] Footprint correct
[X] Matches the suggested schematic
[X] Pin-out pin numbers match

* ADC
[X] Footprint correct

* DDC level switches
[X] Footprints correct for the MOSFETs, both for the input and output VGAs.
